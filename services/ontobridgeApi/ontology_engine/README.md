## Rules implementation remarks

### Date Vs DateFrom

```json 
      "id": "mmr:rule-3",
      "sourcePath": "Date", --> should be dateFrom (or defaulted)
      "targetClass": "soo:Experience",
      "targetProperty": "dateFrom",
      "targetFunction": "fno:date-to-xsd"
```

### as-IS function imply lowercase

```Python
if rule.targetFunction == "fno:as-is":
  currentInstance[rule.targetProperty] = str(document[rule.sourcePath]).lower()
  continue
```

### gamingtest-rules-structure inconsistent with gamingtest-rules

Rules in the gamingtest-rules-structure are not coherent with the one of gamingtest-rules. (can't remember why)
I used the gamingtest-rules.

### No way to know the correct language for this rule

```json
      "id": "mmr:rule-4",
      "sourcePath": "Associated Soft Skill Block",
      "targetClass": "soo:Skill",
      "generateId": "true",
      "targetFunction": "fno:search-for-mapping-with-source",
      "relationTo": "soo:Experience",
      "relationName": "soo:resultFromExperience",
      "relationNameInverse": "soo:hasSkill"
```

```Python
if rule.targetFunction == "fno:search-for-mapping-with-source":
    currentInstance['prefLabel'] = {}
    currentInstance['prefLabel']['@value'] = document[rule.sourcePath]
    currentInstance['prefLabel']['@language'] = 'en'
```

## Description

The primary function of this software engine is to generate a [RDF](#rdfs) file following the model.yaml (an simplified description of an ontology), the rules of transformation and a json file with the data to be included.
This conversion involves interpreting the YAML data according to predefined transformation rules that dictate how to map YAML structures to RDF triples.

## Environment

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as dependency management and packaging in Python. This is a [cheat sheet](https://www.yippeecode.com/topics/python-poetry-cheat-sheet/) for basic usage.

### Libraries

#### Test framework

We use the [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) library : ```pip install pytest```. This is [article that explain python testing with PyTest](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/).

#### Yaml

We use the [pyyaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) library : ```pip install pyyaml```. This is [an example of CRUD operations on yaml](https://python.land/data-processing/python-yaml).

#### RDFS

##### Online Course : Cambridge Semantics

[Cambridge Semantics](https://cambridgesemantics.com/blog/semantic-university/learn-rdf/) presents a RDF 101 Course.

- RDF is a graph data model.
- RDF data are directed, labeled graphs.
- A single edge in an RDF graph is a 3-tuple that is called either a statement or triple.
- Triples are organized into named graphs, forming 4-tuples, or quads.
- RDF resources (nodes), predicates (edges), and named graphs are labeled by URIs.
- Although preferable to reuse URIs when possible, Semantic Web technologies, including OWL and SPARQL, make it easy to resolve URI conflicts, as weâ€™ll see in future lessons.
