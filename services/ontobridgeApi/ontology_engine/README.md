## interim Rules implementation

[exemples](https://gitlab.com/mmorg/bupm/ariane/-/tree/26-create-other-test-transformation-files-and-output/services/data-mapping/__tests__/interim?ref_type=heads)

### Changes in rules

- "relationNameInverse": "soo:profile" to "relationNameInverse": "soo:Profile"
- "targetProperty": "soo:adress", To "targetProperty": "soo:address",
- rules-id unicity corection: "id": "mmr:rule-5" instead of  "id": "mmr:rule-4", (already assign)
- "sourcePath": "certifications.contractType", to "sourcePath": "suggestedExperiences.contractType",
- move profile section to help comparison

### Note on implementation

"fno:find-or-create-term" raises question in term of implementation. (to be discuss)

### Changes in minimal output

- id changed to match other provider : profile key is tr:__profile-id-1__, experience is tr:__generated-id-1__





## jobready Rules implementation

[exemples](https://gitlab.com/mmorg/bupm/ariane/-/tree/main/services/data-mapping/__tests__/jobready?ref_type=heads)

### Change in output

change the context to match de the context

```json
"@todo": "Define later with https://gitlab.com/mmorg/bupm/ariane/-/blob/main/data/soo/onto-soo-context-1.0.0.jsonld"
```

instead of:

```json
"@TODO": "define the result context"
```

## gamingtest Rules implementation

### Date Vs DateFrom

```json
      "id": "mmr:rule-3",
      "sourcePath": "Date", --> should be dateFrom (or defaulted)
      "targetClass": "soo:Experience",
      "targetProperty": "dateFrom",
      "targetFunction": "fno:date-to-xsd"
```

### as-IS function imply lowercase

"Results": "Validated" / "result": "validated"

```Python
if rule.targetFunction == "fno:as-is":
  currentInstance[rule.targetProperty] = str(document[rule.sourcePath]).lower()
  continue
```

### gamingtest-rules-structure inconsistent with gamingtest-rules

Rules in the gamingtest-rules-structure are not coherent with the one of gamingtest-rules. (can't remember why)
I used the gamingtest-rules.

### No way to know the correct language for this rule

```json
      "id": "mmr:rule-4",
      "sourcePath": "Associated Soft Skill Block",
      "targetClass": "soo:Skill",
      "generateId": "true",
      "targetFunction": "fno:search-for-mapping-with-source",
      "relationTo": "soo:Experience",
      "relationName": "soo:resultFromExperience",
      "relationNameInverse": "soo:hasSkill"
```

```Python
if rule.targetFunction == "fno:search-for-mapping-with-source":
    currentInstance['prefLabel'] = {}
    currentInstance['prefLabel']['@value'] = document[rule.sourcePath]
    currentInstance['prefLabel']['@language'] = 'en'
```

## Description

The primary function of this software engine is to generate a [RDF](#rdfs) file following the model.yaml (an simplified description of an ontology), the rules of transformation and a json file with the data to be included.
This conversion involves interpreting the YAML data according to predefined transformation rules that dictate how to map YAML structures to RDF triples.

## Environment

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as dependency management and packaging in Python. This is a [cheat sheet](https://www.yippeecode.com/topics/python-poetry-cheat-sheet/) for basic usage.

### Libraries

#### Test framework

We use the [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) library : ```pip install pytest```. This is [article that explain python testing with PyTest](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/).

#### Yaml

We use the [pyyaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) library : ```pip install pyyaml```. This is [an example of CRUD operations on yaml](https://python.land/data-processing/python-yaml).

#### RDFS

##### Online Course : Cambridge Semantics

[Cambridge Semantics](https://cambridgesemantics.com/blog/semantic-university/learn-rdf/) presents a RDF 101 Course.

- RDF is a graph data model.
- RDF data are directed, labeled graphs.
- A single edge in an RDF graph is a 3-tuple that is called either a statement or triple.
- Triples are organized into named graphs, forming 4-tuples, or quads.
- RDF resources (nodes), predicates (edges), and named graphs are labeled by URIs.
- Although preferable to reuse URIs when possible, Semantic Web technologies, including OWL and SPARQL, make it easy to resolve URI conflicts, as weâ€™ll see in future lessons.
